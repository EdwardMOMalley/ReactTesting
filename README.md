This is a simple demonstration of testing a react/electron project using jest

The project was setup using this boilerplate repository: https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate

It has two simple test cases that check if certain react components are being rendered on the screen.

1. Writing a simple test case:

 Writing a test case for Electron/React using Jest involves creating a Jest test file, importing the necessary components, and using Jest functions like describe and it to define test suites and individual tests. You can use Jest's built-in functions like expect to make assertions about the behavior of your components, ensuring they work as intended. Mocking and spying functionalities can also be utilized to isolate and test specific parts of your code.

2. Executing the test:

  npm install

  npm run build
  
  npm run test
