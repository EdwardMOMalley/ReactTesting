This is a simple demonstration of testing a react/electron project using jest

The project was setup using this boilerplate repository: https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate

It has two simple test cases that check if certain react components are being rendered on the screen.

To run: npm install, npm run build, npm run test
